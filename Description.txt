 -->automatic control is the use of various control system for operating any equipment or device such as a remote controlled (toy) car .

-->other useful applications with minimal or reduced human interventions. 

-->Arduino Uno , an H-bridge L293D IC for motor controller , and four electric DC motors are used to move the automobile.
 
-->The  objectives  of  this  project  are  controlling  the  car  wireless communication  system.

-->The test result shows that the controlled car can move in any direction.

-->However, the performance depends on the device signal strength where the maximum testing range is only about 20 meters’ distance from 
the user’s location.

 ************************************************Conclusion:**************************************************************************

-->Possibilities of wireless technology are    limitless and many tests are in progress to support autonomous driving, connected vehicles and smart 
car technologies. Wireless robots are deployed in the manufacturing plants to support production, increase efficiency and precision. Effective 
use of modern wireless technologies integrated with automobiles will offer a much convenient and safer road trip in future.
